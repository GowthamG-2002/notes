Datasheet:
AHB1 bus - the starting address is A .
GPIO A , GPIOB- have 7 regiters.
inS
•): all registers have to give the addresses.
•) the base address of the register
•) offset of the regiter.
Lightw
→ 1 addres have 8 byte - byte
adaressable
The Numbers are convert , when the pointes (typecast) to unsigned integer known as address.
the value in an address is represented
by （*）
 TYPEDEF:
- IO → Represente volatile.
*) it is a structure, used to Create a variable with GPIO _ Typedef
*) GPIO A → pointer to the Structure.
(GPIO - typedef *) declared in pointer.
