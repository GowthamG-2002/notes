communications:
    Serial communications
         sender -> recieverl

    Parallel communications
         sender -> Reciever

*) Protocols → set of mules

*) Parallel: 8-bit data is transformed the smae time.

*) serial : 8-bit data is transformed one bit at the time.

*) Synchronous: clock is transmitted with the data.

*) Аshynchronous:
      • No dock is tranemitled
      • transmitter with reciver clock speed for the data transmission (Baudrate)

*)MBps → mega bit per second.

UART:
    *)UART is a Gerial connection.


UART :
universal Asynchronous Reciever (Transmitter)

USART :
universal Synchronous reciever /trarmitte

Duplex: Data can be transmitted and recieved

simplex:[FM madio]
    *)Data can be transmitted recieved only one direction only.
Half duplex:
    *)Data can be transmitted in only one way at a time. [walky talky)
full duplex:
    *) Data can be tranmitted in both ways [mobile]


*)In asynchronous transmission each byte is Packed  between start and stop


i)Bauderate

ii)word length

iii)Stop bit

iv)Parity.
