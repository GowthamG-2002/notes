communications:
    Serial communications
         sender -> recieverl

    Parallel communications
         sender -> Reciever

*) Protocols → set of mules

*) Parallel: 8-bit data is transformed the smae time.

*) serial : 8-bit data is transformed one bit at the time.

*) Synchronous: clock is transmitted with the data.

*) Аshynchronous:
      • No dock is tranemitled
      • transmitter with reciver clock speed for the data transmission (Baudrate)

*)MBps → mega bit per second.

UART:
    *)UART is a Gerial connection.
