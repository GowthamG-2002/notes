AJaS
*) Base + ofset + tarling
address
# define PERIPHERAL BASE
# define AHB1 PERIPHERAL - OFFSET

# define GPIDA - BASE

Peripheral:
GIPIO which hase address for Space
→ the space has registers.
→ In previous program we called the already present Aspare value are going to asign our sun @tructure.
→ addres are
found in tabde
* GPIDA to GPIDH has the came memory register but different addres
*) Base (starting)
